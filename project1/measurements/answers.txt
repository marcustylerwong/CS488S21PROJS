If we want h1 to communicate with h4, we see that it would have to follow a path that includes
L1, L2, and L3. From this we can estimate that both the latency and throughput of the path between
h1 and h4 would be at least the summation of the latencies and throughputs of these individual paths.

L1 latency avg = 81.958ms
L2 latency avg = 21.755ms
L3 latency avg = 61.848ms
h1 to h4 estimated avg latency = 165.561ms

L1 server recv rate/client send rate = 20.264 Mbps / 23.854 Mbps
L2 server recv rate/client send rate = 36.717 Mbps / 41.336 Mbps
L3 server recv rate/client send rate = 30.78 Mbps / 34.04 Mbps
h1 to h4 estimate avg server recv rate/client send rate = 87.761 Mbps / 99.12 Mbps
